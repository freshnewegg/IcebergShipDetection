# IcebergShipDetection

This submission was my first attempt at KAGGLE machine learning contests. I submitted this project for the https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge

My implementation was a CNN using Keras. I based my CNN on the Squeeze archtecture proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360

Final Score was like 0.18 which was like 250th place 

#Learnings
*Convolutional Neural Networks
*Data wrangling
*Neural network archtecture
*Early Stopping & other heuristics
*To win kaggle contests, u need a boatton of GPU's cause everybodys usin ensemble models
